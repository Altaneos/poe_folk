# poe_folk COM port notifier

This project is a simple windows application that runs in the background
and issues a pop-up when you plug in or remove a serial device with a message like:
COM2 Plugged in

See [the changelog](CHANGELOG.md) to see what's changed over time.

## Getting Started

Go to https://github.com/lime45/poe_folk/releases and download setup.exe
and COM.Port.Notify.msi

Run setup.exe to install on your computer. When it is installed, the executable will
be (roughly) here: C:\Program Files (x86)\lime45\COM Port Notify.

## Usage
1. If you click on the popup balloon, the COM port text will be placed on the clipboard.
2. Right clicking on the tray icon allows you to either: close this app, or add/remove this app from windows startup.
